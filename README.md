# Group Bot Telegram

A modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with a sqlalchemy database.

Originally a Marie fork, The GroupBot evolved further and was built to be more robust and more dedicated to Anime Chats. 

The Support group can be reached out to at [DraX Robots Support](https://t.me/DraXRobotsSupport), where you can ask for help setting up your bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available.
